The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a database reference before it's fully initialized.  This often happens when you attempt to read or write data within a component's `componentDidMount` lifecycle method before Firebase has completed its initialization process. The initialization often involves asynchronous operations, so it is not guaranteed to be complete immediately when your code runs.
